				<p>About Me</p>
				<p>When looking deep inside for what drives me, I find that design and art are what inspires many. I am not your everyday artist with pen and paper in hand, but one who looks to learn as much of the digital design and art concepts as possible. This is a new beginning for me. It is a road less travel or never thought of. I look to be amongst those who are not only good at what they do, but to be one who loves, enjoys, and inspires with the creation of my designs and art. It is a lesson to be learned. I am a future web developer and designer, and just the future of the web.
A designer has many talents. These talents come from deep within. We are a network of inspiration among ourselves. We find inspiration in many things and see art where others may not. I am compiling my on component library for future projects that come from those that have inspired me. These elements will help in my development and strategy to help me produce inspiring future works.
